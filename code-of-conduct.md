# The Debuggy Code of Conduct

<!-- Class is required to distinguish the element for styling reasons. -->
<p class="updated">Edited: 2023-04-09</p>

## Opening

Participating in Debuggy community spaces requires you to follow the Code of Conduct as outlined below.
Not reading the Code of Conduct is not a valid reason for breaking it. Every person participating in
Debuggy community spaces will be held to this standard.

The Debuggy Code of Conduct is based off of
the [Quilt Code of Conduct](https://quiltmc.org/en/community/code-of-conduct/)
with some parts being modified while other parts being verbatim.

## Our Pledge

We as community members, contributors, and team members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone,
regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity & expression, nationality, physical or mental disabilities or
differences (regardless of intensity),
politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or subcultural affiliation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community,
and we are committed to promoting these concepts.

## Our Standards

We expect the members of our community to participate in a positive, authentic and deliberate way.
Consideration, respect and empathy are key when it comes to building and supporting a healthy community,
and we request that our members exercise this through their actions.

Please take into account that online communities bring people together from many different cultures and backgrounds.
It’s important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to
misunderstandings.

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Being empathetic, kind and patient towards others
- Being respectful to other people regardless of their opinions, viewpoints and experiences
- Being graceful when giving and/or accepting constructive feedback
- Respecting others' choices even if their choices don't line up with yours
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes as well as learning from the experience
- Focusing on what's best for the community as well as for individuals

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Usage of sexualized language and/or media
- Making sexual advances of any kind
- Making derogatory comments, insulting people and/or trolling
- Attacking people personally and/or politically
- Making violent threats and/or acting violently towards others
- Harassing others via any means
- Dead-naming or misgendering others on purpose
- Posting personal info (such as email or physical addresses) of others (aka "doxxing")
- Attempting to gatekeep access to mental health and/or accessibility tools
- Encouraging people to break rules and/or behave inappropriately

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community team members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and
fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the members of the community team may take any
action they deem appropriate.
Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from the community, exclusion from any
interaction,
and loss of all rights in the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline), as well as when an individual is
officially representing the community in
public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official
social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces that are managed by Debuggy,
regardless of whether or not the use of this code is explicitly called out.
We also reserve the right to retroactively enforce this Code of Conduct when community members violate it in spaces not
managed by Debuggy.

## Reporting a Problem

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Debuggy community team
directly on Discord
via private message. If your report concerns a specific community team member or group of community team members,
please send your report to a team member that is not part of the report, or a Debuggy community manager.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all team members are obligated to respect the
privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.

## Changes and Feedback

It is likely that this Code of Conduct will need additions, modifications and other improvements.
Online culture changes, new views and sensitivities emerge which need to be taken into account.
To that end, we reserve the right to update this Code of Conduct at any time, pending feedback from the community when
possible.

We always welcome feedback and suggestions. If you’d like to provide either, feel free to open an issue on GitHub!
